        "In 1914, Europe was a tinderbox of tension and military rivalry. The spark for war could have been many incidents; but, as it happened the assassination of an Austrian Archduke – Franz Ferdinand by a Serb provoked widespread declarations of war and the fulfilment of treaties which led to the horrendous conflict of the First World War.canadian-troops-over-top1-first-world-war The war was to last four years and cost the lives of millions of men and women from all corners of the world. The First World War also led to profound social change. After the First World War, there was increased recognition for the role of women in society, with many countries giving women the vote. There was also greater emphasis placed on the role of the working class, who had fought and died in the war, and now wanted a better peace. In 1918/19 there was global flu pandemic which killed nearly 50 million people (many young adults) but such was the carnage of the First World War, it had only a limited effect on changing the world as many governments downplayed its impact."

        "Since the publication of Marx’s Communist Manifesto, there had been sporadic Communist revolutions in European countries, but nothing had really succeeded. But in October 1917, the Bolshevik revolution, led by Lenin, brought about a radical new form of government with worldwide implications. Lenin was a fervent Marxist and wasted little time in implementing his version of a ‘dictatorship of the Proletariat’. Communist Russia divided the world. It was seen by some as an alternative to the inequities of Capitalism and by others as an embodiment of totalitarianism and lack of freedom. The Soviet Union transformed the lives of Russian people – it led to economic growth, but also increased political repression. The ideology of the Soviet Union also led to a prolonged ‘Cold War’ – with an ideological divide between western democracy and Soviet Communism."

        "After the First World War, American President Woodrow Wilson promoted an idealistic 14 points and creation of a new “League of Nations” to help prevent war. However, the American Senate voted against joining the League of Nations and France and Britain sought ‘reparations’ from Germany and the defeated powers. Germany was occupied by French troops until the mid 1920s and the German army severely limited. These restrictions were considered ‘humiliating’ by many German army officers and this sense of ‘betrayal’ would be exploited by Hitler in the coming years. French general Ferdinand Foch stated. “This is not peace. It is an armistice for twenty years.” The Treaty of Versailles and other similar treaties arbitrarily re-drew the map of the world – creating new countries, such as Czechoslovakia, Finland, Poland, Latvia, and Yugoslavia out of ethnically mixed populations, which would prove problematic many years later. Just 20 years later, Hitler would plunge the continent into conflict for a second time in an effort to restore lost pride."

This led to a prolonged fall in share [roce and precipitated the global great depression. Unemployment rose to 25% in US with output and trade falling around the world. The widespread poverty and sense of alienation led to the growth of political extremes across the world. Japan and Germany both turned to far-right nationalist movements, which led to military expansionism and the Second World War. In America, the Great Depression led to the election of FDR and a great expansion in the size of the Federal government as people wanted the government to intervene in dealing with the depression."

The invasion of a sovereign nation finally convinced the allies – Great Britain and France of Hitler’s wider intentions for the occupation of Europe. After appeasing Hitler over Austria and Czechoslovakia, Poland proved the final straw and on September 3rd, 1939, Great Britain declared war on Nazi Germany. The Second World War was to last until May 1945, costing the lives of approximately 50 million people. Less well known is that under a secret Nazi-Soviet pact the Soviet Union also occupied parts of Poland at the same time as Germany’s invasion."

A key moment in world history was in May 1940, when there was a debate in the British government whether to seek a deal with Hitler or continue to fight. Winston Churchill was adamant Britain should never surrender and refused to consider signing a deal. From June 1940, the German airforce attacked British airbases as a prelude to invasion. Although the number of combatants was small, the German airforce suffered sufficient losses to discourage the invasion plan and Hitler withdrew from imminent invasion."

The invasion was initially successfully coming close to Moscow at the end of 1941. The invasion brought the Soviet Union into the global conflict and was a turning point in the fortunes of Germany as they struggled to fight on two fronts. Millions died both armed forces and civilians in the bitterest fighting of the Second World War. The invasion changed the Soviet Union, turning it into a major power and giving it a reason to ‘liberate’ eastern Europe before Stalin decided to install Communist regimes in Eastern Europe at the end of the war."

After many years denying Indian calls for independence, Britain finally agreed to full Indian independence in 1947. Indian independence was accompanied by a painful separation and the birth of a new nation – Pakistan. The separation led to painful incidences of sectarian violence and killing; it led to the migration of many millions of people who found themselves on the wrong side of the border. The independence of India also created a newly independent nation which claimed allegiance to neither the US or the Soviet Union – but a third way as Nehru called it.

In March 2020 Italy became the first country in the western world to implement a lockdown to try and stop the rapid escalation of the virus. There soon followed widespread global ‘lockdowns’ with people confined to their homes and business shut down. Despite travel bans, the virus spread to all countries around the world. This lockdown had a profound adverse effect on the global economy with a sharp rise in unemployment and a fall in output. It also challenged long-held view of invulnerability amongst western developed countries. The long-term impact of the pandemic is uncertain, but it will lead to structural changes in the economy and the balance of the world. China is both seen as the source of the virus, but also – as the world’s dominant manufacturer – is a key player in the efforts to manufacture equipment to deal with the crisis."

But Jack decided he was tired of milking cows. “No way, no how. I’m not milking this brown cow now,” said Jack, and he decided to sell the old cow, so he’d never have to milk it again! Jack was on his way to market to sell the cow when he came across a peddler. “Hi, Mr. Peddler,” said Jack. “Where are you headed?” asked the peddler. “I’m going to sell my cow at the market,” Jack answered. “Why sell your cow?” asked the peddler. “Trade her for beans!” “Beans?” asked Jack. “Not just any kind of beans,” said the peddler, “magic beans.” “What do they do?” asked Jack. “They do magic!” said the peddler. “Magic? Sold!” said Jack, and he traded the cow for three magic beans. Jack got home and told his mama he had sold the cow so he wouldn’t have to milk her anymore. “Oh dear, you did what?” Jack’s mama asked. “I sold her for magic beans,” said Jack. “You sold a cow for magic beans?” Jack’s mama couldn’t believe what Jack was telling her. “There’s no such thing as magic beans,” she said as she threw the beans out the window. “Well, I did make them disappear, but that still doesn’t make them magic!” Suddenly, the ground rumbled and began to shake. A magic beanstalk grew up right before their eyes! Jack saw it and immediately began to climb the tall beanstalk. “Get back here this instant!” called Jack’s mama, but Jack wasn’t listening. Jack climbed up and up and up and up the beanstalk. At the top of the beanstalk, Jack found a giant castle. He walked up to the giant door, cracked it open, and went inside. Inside the castle, Jack saw the most amazing thing he had ever seen. It was a goose. But it wasn’t just any old ordinary goose. This goose laid eggs made of gold! “That is so cool,” thought Jack. “Think of all the things you could do with golden eggs!” And then, Jack got the worst idea he’d ever had—he was going to take the goose! Jack lifted the goose off of its perch. Just then, the biggest, most fearsome, and only giant Jack had ever seen came into the room. The giant saw that his goose wasn’t in its usual spot! “Fee fi fo funch, if you took my goose, I’ll eat you for lunch!” “Oh no,” thought Jack. “That giant’s going to eat me! I’ve got to get out of here without him seeing me!” Quietly and carefully, Jack took the goose and made his way toward the door. He was almost out of the room when—honk! The goose cried out and the giant spotted Jack! “Fee fi fo fummy, give that back or I’ll call my mummy!” roared the giant. “Ahhh!” screamed Jack. He ran toward the beanstalk. Jack ran as quickly as he could down the beanstalk, but the giant was following close behind. Just as Jack put his feet back on the ground, the giant picked up Jack in his enormous hands. “Fee fi fo fummy, I bet you taste yum yum yummy!” said the giant. Just as the giant was about to eat Jack, the ground began to shake, and there, standing right behind the giant, was an even bigger, taller, more humongous lady giant! “Two giants!” thought Jack. “They’ll eat me now for sure!” “Put that boy down, Willifred,” the giant mama told her son. The giant put Jack back down on the ground. “Now what have I told you?” she asked. “Don’t eat other kids,” said the giant sheepishly. “That’s right, we don’t eat other kids,” said the mama giant. “But he took my goose!” cried the giant. Just then, Jack’s mama came out of the farmhouse. “What on earth is going on here?” she asked. “Well,” Jack began, “there was this castle, and inside was the coolest goose ever—it lays golden eggs! As I was taking it, this giant kid came in and was all ‘fee fi fo fum’ and then I—” “You mean you took this boy’s goose?” Jack’s mama interrupted. “Yeah, but it lays golden eggs!” Jack paused and thought about it. “Huh. Now that you mention it, I guess that wasn’t very nice,” said Jack. Jack looked at the giant. “I’m sorry I took your goose. I know I shouldn’t take things that don’t belong to me.” “That’s OK. I suppose I should’ve asked you to give me back the goose without trying to eat you. I’m sorry too,” said the giant. “Hey, do you want to play baseball?” Jack and the giant became good friends, using the beanstalk to visit each other whenever they wanted. “You know,” Jack said, “if it weren’t for those three magic beans, I never would have learned how to play giant baseball.” “You’re right,” said the giant. “I’d say the whole adventure was a giant success!”",

      "In 1922, Albert Einstein was staying in a hotel in Tokyo. Without any money to tip a hotel deliveryman, he instead gave him a couple of notes on hotel stationery about happiness and success. While the man was probably unable to read the advice, he recognized their value and held on to them. In October of this year, the deliveryman’s nephew sold the notes for 1.3 million dollars. One note said, “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.” The other said, “A calm and humble life will bring more happiness than the pursuit of success and the constant restlessness that comes with it.” Multi-millionaire Mo Gawdat curiously came to a similar conclusion as Einstein after trying to find his own formula for happiness. On paper, his life ticked every box. He was a top Google executive. He lived in a huge house. He married his university sweetheart and fathered two beautiful children. He was incredibly wealthy. Once he purchased a vintage Rolls-Royce at the drop of a hat. People thought he had the perfect life, but Mo was as miserable as sin. Mo believed happiness could be captured in a computer code. He wanted to develop an algorithm which could bring complete happiness. Together with his son Ali, they created a formula. Mo thought it nailed the art of happiness. And then something terrible happened. Ali was rushed to the hospital for a routine appendix removal. A needle punctured a major artery by mistake. His 21-year-old son’s organs were failing one by one. The time had come to say goodbye. Mo and his wife kissed Ali’s forehead and left the hospital. Grief overwhelmed them. Mo blamed the doctors for his son’s death, and he blamed himself. His wife told him blaming other people would not bring Ali back. This struck a chord with Mo. He began to look at Ali’s death in a different light. He heard his son’s voice in his head saying, “I’ve already died, Papa. There is nothing you can do to change that, so make the best of it.” Whenever Mo’s mind drifted toward negativity, he would ask what would Ali say in this situation. In the wake of Ali’s death, his father remembered the happiness formula his son had helped him create. H ≥ e – E. “Happiness is greater than or equal to the events of life, minus the expectations of life.” He realized that his striving for material things wasn’t making him happy. And his expectations for the way he thought life should be also weren’t making him happy. Mo says, “I’ve changed my expectations. Rather than thinking that my son should never have died, I choose to be grateful for the times we had.” Mo now believes that happiness isn’t something we should strive for. It’s about enjoying the present moment and being content with what we’ve got as opposed to what we want.",
      "Vietnamese man, Thái Ngoc, got a fever in 1973 and hasn’t slept since. You would expect his life to be a train wreck, but he claims to be going strong. He is a farmer and has no problem doing manual labor to support his family. He even spends some nights doing extra farm work. Ngoc hasn’t been studied by scientists, so his story should be taken with a grain of salt. Some think that people with severe insomnia might mistake very short naps for just resting. While Ngoc says he is in perfect health, most of us are suffering from a lack of Z’s. In 1942, over 92% of people got more than six hours of sleep every night. Now, only about 50% of people get this much sleep, and it’s wreaking havoc on our health. Sleep strongly affects our immune system and that’s why when humans get sick, our first instinct is often to sleep. Sleep helps us to heal, as well as to prevent disease. Even a single night of 5 to 6 hours of sleep causes the number of cancer-fighting cells in the body to drop by an astonishing 70 percent. In fact, more than 20 large-scale studies report that people who sleep less will live a shorter life. Adults over 45 who sleep less than 6 hours a night are 200 percent more likely to have a heart attack than those who get 8 or more hours of shut-eye. Matthew Walker, a sleep scientist, says there’s a connection between sleep loss and Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and poor mental health, among other things. So why the dramatic decrease in sleep? We work longer hours and commute further. We consume too much alcohol and caffeine. Our society is more anxious, lonely and depressed than ever. And we spend too much time under artificial lights and in front of our computers and phones. All of these things are hurting our ability to get a restful night’s sleep. So, what can we do to improve our health through sleep? Walker suggests going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, no matter what. He also says to avoid pulling all-nighters and make sure to leave your phone and laptop outside of your bedroom. If you have trouble getting to sleep, try taking a hot bath. The amount of sleep a person needs will vary according to age, but 8 hours is a good rule of thumb. It may not always be possible, but do your best to get a good night’s sleep – your body will thank you for it!",
      "Daryl Davis is a black man who has made a name for himself befriending white supremacists. Davis learned about racism at a young age. In 1968, the ten-year-old boy was marching in a Boy Scouts parade when people started throwing rocks and bottles at him. He thought that they must really hate the Boy Scouts until he realized none of the other boys was getting hit. Davis was the only black Boy Scout marching that day. When he got home, his parents explained that there were people in the world who hated him because of the color of his skin. From that day onward, he became fascinated with racism. Davis grew up to become a professional blues musician, and that’s when his fascination became something else entirely. It all started at a gig in 1983. He had just finished playing when a white musician approached him and paid him a compliment. They hit it off, and the man told Davis something surprising. He said he had never conversed with a black man before. When Davis asked why, he said he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The Ku Klux Klan – or KKK – is a white supremacy group that dates back to 1866. They are notorious for having terrorized and killed black people from the mid-19th century up until the mid-20th century. Although the reviled group has drastically diminished in numbers, they are still alive in small pockets. Amazingly, Davis and the KKK member kept in touch and became friends, often meeting at Davis’s gigs. One day, Davis told him that he wanted to meet Roger Kelly, a leader of the KKK in Maryland where they lived. His friend warned him against it, saying that he would be killed. But Davis had a question that he wanted to ask Kelly and he wouldn’t take no for an answer. He wanted to know how a person could hate someone that they didn’t know. Davis met with Kelly. Kelly brought an armed guard and there were some very tense moments. But after their conversation, Kelly shook Davis’s hand and told him to stay in touch. This surprised Davis. He hadn’t expected to make another friend, but soon Kelly was visiting him at his house. Davis soon befriended two other KKK leaders from Maryland. And when Kelly became the national leader of the KKK, Davis started going to their rallies. He did this to learn about them and to allow them to learn about him. He thought that if they knew him and liked him, they would begin to question their beliefs. And if he challenged them respectfully, they might change their beliefs. It seems that Davis was right. Eventually, Kelly and the two other KKK leaders in the state of Maryland quit the white supremacy group. Soon after the leaders quit, others followed suit. According to Davis, the KKK no longer exists in Maryland, and it happened because of his efforts. Of course, not everyone agrees with Davis’s methods. In fact, many believe that he is hurting the cause more than he is helping it. Some critics say that instead of helping bigots, he should be helping his own people. They believe that he is sitting down with the enemy and giving racists tacit approval by befriending them. They say it allows racists to justify their beliefs and see themselves as reasonable. Even so, Davis is sticking to his guns. He believes that the best way to work through an issue is to talk about it openly and honestly. He claims to be responsible for changing the hearts of two hundred white supremacists, so he must be doing something right.",
      "The Treaty Oak tree was an old and cherished member of the community. For 600 years, it had stood proudly over the spot where the city of Austin, Texas would one day be. The tree was revered by the native people who predated the city. According to a legend, the tree stood as a witness when European settlers made a treaty with the Native Americans. It was a magnificent tree with branches stretching over 130 feet. The Treaty Oak was loved by all… except for one deranged man, who tried to kill it. One day in 1989, the residents of Austin noticed that their favorite tree had a patch of dead grass beneath it. Upon further examination, they saw that the base of the tree also showed signs of disease. Residents were horrified when they discovered that it was not a natural disease. The tree had been poisoned. Distraught, people came together to save the Treaty Oak. A total of $100,000 was donated to the tree’s recovery. While people were frantically trying to save the tree, the police were on a manhunt for the culprit. They offered a $10,000 reward for information. Before long, they found and convicted Paul Cullen. It turned out that he had poisoned the tree while conducting an occult ritual. The ritual required the death of an oak tree and was intended to end the love he had for a woman and protect her from another man. He also saw the tree’s death as revenge for the outdoor work the state of Texas forced him to do while he was in prison. Cullen was sentenced to spend nine years in prison and pay a $1000 fine. In the end, he only served 3 years. The Treaty Oak’s recovery was touch-and-go at first, and half the tree died. Experts replaced the soil to remove the poison and allow the fresh soil to absorb more poison from the tree. And they installed a sprinkler system to ensure that it always had enough water. Many gave offerings of gifts and cards. And some took more mystical measures. For example, a psychic from Dallas tried to heal the tree by transferring energy into it. Thanks to all the help given by the community, the Treaty Oak still stands proudly over Austin. In 1997, it even sprouted its first acorns since being poisoned. The community dutifully planted them in the hopes of continuing the tree’s legacy.",
      "Csanad Szegedi hated Jewish people until he learned that he himself was a Jew. Szegedi was a Hungarian politician who believed that Jews were a greedy and scheming people who stood in the way of Hungary being a proud Christian nation. He made his feelings clear on talk shows, stages, and in the country’s parliament. He became the Vice President of a radical nationalist party, which encouraged hatred of other cultures. He even co-founded a militia, which was later disbanded for generating ethnic tension and threatening public order through its militaristic demonstrations. He sold nationalist products in his store and pushed nationalist propaganda in his media company. His entire professional reputation was built on his hatred and fear of other cultures. As his nationalist party grew, so did his fame. In 2012, something happened that Szegedi could never have expected. An acquaintance, who held a grudge against Szegedi, somehow found his maternal grandmother’s birth certificate. He informed Szegedi that his blonde haired, blue-eyed grandmother was actually Jewish. When Szegedi confronted his grandmother about being Jewish, she confirmed his fear. She was a survivor of Auschwitz. She had covered the concentration camp number tattooed on her arm her whole life. She had hidden her heritage because she no longer wanted to be Jewish. His late grandfather, it turned out, had also been a survivor of the Holocaust. Szegedi’s identity was shattered. He no longer knew who he was and he fell into a depression. After hiding the knowledge for a few months, the story broke. The cat was out of the bag . His political career was in ruins. These days, Szegedi says he has learned from his mistakes. He has visited Auschwitz. He has burned copies of his nationalist biography. He has even converted to an ultra-orthodox form of Judaism. And to add to the absurdity of his life story, he claims he is now an activist against anti-semitism in Europe. Not everyone is convinced though. Szegedi has been welcomed by some, but has been turned away by others who are not so quick to forgive his past. Some even question whether he was truly ignorant of his Jewish heritage while he was spreading hate as a nationalist politician. A leopard can’t change his spots is an English expression that means we are who we are. Even if a person pretends to change on the outside, their true nature remains the same. Others believe that even the most depraved can turn over a new leaf. What do you think?",
      "Derek Simmons was enjoying a beautiful day at the beach with his family when he noticed something odd. A group of people near the pier were pointing at something in the water. He and his wife thought it was just another shark, but they walked toward the commotion anyway. As it turned out, it wasn’t a shark. It was something much more dangerous. Nine people were caught in a riptide. That group included a family of six with two small boys and a grandmother, as well as three would-be rescuers who got pulled in while trying to help. They were trying to swim to safety but the current was too strong and they were being pulled away. The lifeguards had already finished work, so it was up to Derek. He had to think fast. The nine were getting tired and would soon be lost at sea and possibly drowned. He gathered as many people as he could on the beach and got them to hold hands in a line. Soon, he had a human chain of more than 80 people. It reached about 100 yards from the beach into the ocean. Derek and his wife, Jessica, went out beyond the chain on their body boards and began towing the exhausted swimmers to people in the chain. The 67-year-old grandmother had a heart attack in the water and appeared to have died by the time they got to her, but the human chain pulled her back to shore too. After about an hour, all nine were passed back along the chain to safety. Even the grandmother survived, saying that she had a vision of her late husband and it wasn’t her time yet. Complete strangers were on the beach hugging and high-fiving. It was a beautiful end to a stressful day at the beach. Some famous philosophers have said that humans are selfish by nature. They believed that even when a person does something that appears to be selfless, there is always an ulterior motive. But according to recent psychology experiments, when making snap decisions, people’s first instincts are to be cooperative and helpful, not selfish. Only when we have time to think and deliberate, do we become selfish. Derek Simmons and the 80 rescuers he gathered certainly had little time to think when they put their lives at risk to save the lives of strangers. Derek later said, “It was a wave of humanity that brings some things back into focus, that maybe we haven’t lost all hope in this world.”",
      "Ben Randall risked his life saving the lives of three friends who were kidnapped and sold as brides. As a young backpacker, Ben befriended and taught English to a group of teenage Hmong girls he met during his travels in Vietnam. After returning home to Australia, he received an email from one of the girls saying that some of their friends had suddenly disappeared. A year later, Ben was back in Vietnam and on the trail of the missing girls. He learned that the Hmong are often targeted to be sold in China where men far outnumber women. The shortage of women has left millions of desperate men without any hope of getting married. And to fill this need, human traffickers have preyed on the likes of Ben’s young friends. Astonishingly, the families of kidnapped girls often choose not to search for their daughters. The parents often either blame their daughters or they believe they are better off in China. This meant Ben’s friends were on their own. One of the kidnapped girls got her hands on a mobile phone. She contacted Blue Dragon Children’s Foundation, a group that has saved hundreds of trafficked children. She had escaped, but did not know where the other two kidnapped girls were. Ben caught a break when one of the girls managed to contact her family. The girls did not know where they were, but Ben and the investigators from Blue Dragon were able to find them. Both girls had lived in captivity in China for three years and had given birth to daughters. One was in a small village and lived a difficult life with very little freedom. The other was in a large city and lived somewhat comfortably. Ben decided to spend the last of his funds to meet them in China. Each reunion was a moment of joy, followed by a difficult decision. His kidnapped friends had to decide whether they would stay or leave. If they left, they would have to leave their daughters behind to an unknown fate. They would have to take a dangerous journey home. And once they had returned, they might be mistrusted by their local community and have difficulty finding a husband. In the end, one decided to return home. It took an additional five months to successfully bring her back to Vietnam. The other stayed with her child in China. Ben thought finding the girls would be the end of his adventure, but it has only just begun. He is now on a mission to save trafficked children and spread the word about the global danger of human trafficking.",
      "The first step on the moon by astronaut Neil Armstrong was said to be “one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” But for many of the twelve men who’ve been there, that “one small step” completely changed the way they saw the world. Some returned feeling as if they’d experienced enlightenment. Others spent the years following their lunar exploration depressed and hiding from the press. Some say that those quiet astronauts saw things the others hadn’t – secret things that they were asked to cover up. After stepping on the moon, Buzz Aldrin’s life fell apart. He went into a deep depression. His marriage of 21 years ended. He remarried and was divorced again within two years. He became an alcoholic. Within a few years, the former astronaut found himself selling used cars to make a living. When approached by the press, he seemed agitated and reluctant to share details of his mission. Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, is also said to have been reclusive and possibly withdrawn. He also frustrated interviewers with his refusals and extremely private nature. Many people have wondered why they would struggle after such an achievement. Some believe it was because the entire moon landing was a hoax. Some think they saw proof of alien life but it was kept quiet. Buzz did say in one interview that he observed a light moving alongside the ship. Others think that Buzz was just jealous at being the second man on the moon and Neil had always been quiet. We may never know because NASA erased the original moon landing footage. Whatever caused their depression, the truth is that there are many oddities about the moon. It has been a source of fascination since the dawn of humanity. Many ancient peoples worshipped it as a god or told legends about it. The Zulu tribe of Africa, for example, tells of two alien brothers who towed the moon into place and gave us the rhythms of the Earth. Even today, its mysteries tantalize our minds. For example, the moon is 400 times smaller than the sun and 400 times closer to the Earth. Because of this mysterious coincidence, when the moon passes in front of the sun during an eclipse, the moon completely blocks the much bigger sun. Yet scientists say that if the moon were not as it is, life may not have evolved past the sea. The moon affects the tides, and the tides made it possible for some sea creatures to reach land, where they eventually evolved into land animals. Robotic landers sent by billionaires looking to mine the moon for gold and other resources are slated to begin as early as 2020. Perhaps some of its secrets will be revealed then.",
      "Love is the most powerful of human emotions, and new love can make us feel alive like nothing else. The other side of love is the pain of love that has come and gone. Most of us have experienced lost love at some point, and many people believe that time heals all wounds. Could there be another way? What if we could erase the pain of lost love? In the movie, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which takes place in the future, a company exists that provides a service to people who want to erase their memories. Here is the story of what happens to a man named Joel: Joel Barish was a quiet, reserved man. His life wasn’t particularly exciting, but he liked things that way. One Valentine’s Day, Joel woke up in a strange mood, which he couldn’t describe. He dressed himself and got ready for work, but when he stepped out the door, he decided not to go. Instead, for some reason he can’t explain, Joel got on a train headed to the beach area of Montauk, Long Island. Once he arrived there, he sat on the beach all by himself and wrote in his journal. While he was writing, a girl with dyed blue hair caught his eye, but he couldn’t find the courage to approach her. On the way home though, it turns out he and the blue-haired girl were on the same train. She introduced herself to Joel as Clementine Kruczynski. Joel felt that the conversation was awkward yet familiar, all at the same time. Even though Clementine had a different personality than Joel, he was still attracted to her. He called her as soon as he got home to make plans with her for the next day. The next night, Joel and Clementine visited the Charles River and laid together on the ice. Their opposite personalities seemed to click and they both felt themselves falling in love with each other. It felt like love at first sight. In reality though, Joel and Clementine were old lovers who had forgotten each other. They first met long before the train ride. They met two years earlier and already shared a passionate relationship. It ended in a lot of emotional pain for both of them. So much so, they wished they could forget about each other. After they broke up, Clementine decided to have all memories of Joel erased from her brain. She contacted a medical company called Lacuna, Inc., which specializes in altering people’s memories. Once the procedure was complete, Clementine no longer had any idea that Joel even existed. Joel on the other hand, still had all his memories of Clementine. At one point, he missed Clementine so badly that he went out looking for her. When he found her, she was kissing another man, and when Joel approached her, she didn’t even recognize him. This upset Joel, since he couldn’t understand how she could forget about him and move on so soon. He discussed his feelings with friends, who told him that Clementine had Joel erased from her memory. After hearing what Clementine did, Joel also decided to erase Clementine from his memory. Two years later, fate or random chance brings Joel and Clementine together again on the beach in Long Island. Now that they are meeting for a second time, they have another chance to make the relationship work. While they don’t remember each other, they do both feel an instant connection to one another. Even though they both feel like they are starting a new relationship, will they be fated to break up in the same way all over again? Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a fictional movie, but there is truth behind the concept of memory alteration. Scientists have discovered a way to alter memories. They hope to be able to erase traumatic memories from a person’s brain. They are still several years away from testing this theory on humans though. Right now, they are using mice as test subjects. The scientists have discovered a gene in the brain called the tet1 gene. This gene is responsible for memory extinction, which is the process of new memories replacing old ones. The theory is, the higher the activity of the tet1 gene, the easier it will be to erase old memories. To test this theory, they placed each mouse into a cage, where once inside, each mouse received an electric shock. The mice began to associate the cage with the electric shock, which was a traumatic experience for them. Then the scientists split the mice into two separate groups. The first group retained their tet1 gene as normal, while the second group had their tet1 gene removed. The mice were then placed inside of the cage again, this time without the electric shock. Over time, the mice with the normal tet1 gene learned to not be afraid of the cage. Their painful memories faded over time. Their new memories replaced the old, traumatic memory of the electric shock, and they no longer had anything to fear. The mice with the tet1 gene removed were just as afraid of the cage as ever. Without the tet1 gene to replace their traumatic memories, the mice’s old memory of the painful electric shock stayed strong. In the future, this research into the tet1 gene may help humans forget painful memories. But it is only a small piece of the puzzle. The scientists have discovered which gene is responsible for replacing old memories. What they haven’t figured out is how to select individual memories they want to replace. For fictional Clementine and Joel, they still kept all the old memories from their past, and erased only the ones they no longer wanted to keep. That is much more advanced than the experiment with the mice. That said, the experiment is definitely moving us in a direction that will change the shape of the human experience. Is erasing painful memories the key to happiness? The search for happiness is a growing fad in the world of psychology. Of course, we all want to be happy, but erasing sad memories might not be the best way. While sadness and pain is something people naturally try to avoid, these situations sometimes give us the greatest opportunity for personal growth. And of course, the pain we experience in our lives doesn’t just make us stronger. The experience of overcoming suffering and learning how to handle pain becomes a part of our identity. Who would you be if you had never experienced the pain of loss? You’d probably be a much different person. And how much sympathy and compassion for others in pain would you have if you had no experience of pain yourself?",
      "Chance was a Brahman bull, but Ralph loved him like a family dog. Brahman bulls weigh between 1,000 and 2,200 pounds. They are intelligent and relatively calm animals, but they have large horns and can be very dangerous. Chance wasn’t one of the dangerous ones. Even though he was more than 2,000 pounds, he would lick Ralph’s face and lovingly rub his head against Ralph’s wife, Sandy. Ralph is the owner of Ralph Fisher’s Photo Animals, a company that provides animals for events around the US. For many years he brought his bull to parades and parties and people would have their picture taken with Chance the bull. Chance was photographed with rock stars, politicians and even met Mother Theresa. He was probably the most photographed bull in history and even appeared in Hollywood movies. Chance was such a trusted animal, that Ralph let him freely leave the fenced area where the other bulls lived. Chance would often peacefully sit in the grass under a tree outside Ralph’s kitchen window. One rainy day Chance didn’t show up to eat and Ralph went looking for him. He had died. Chance was 19 years old, and had lived a good life, but Ralph was devastated by his death. He planned to have Chance stuffed so he could hold onto the memory of his dear pet, but first he had to skin him. Ralph loved this bull like a family member. It was a tough thing to do, but he got his knife and got to work. He skinned and cried and skinned and cried all day in the rain until he was done. Three months earlier Chance went to Texas AM University to have a mole removed. Ralph heard that the university was planning to clone an animal. He knew that Chance was getting old and wouldn’t live long. Chance was 19 years old, which was 88 years old in people years. Ralph begged the doctors at the university to clone Chance. At first they refused, but Ralph wouldn’t leave them alone. Finally they agreed to do it. Ten months after Chance died, Chance’s clone was born. Ralph named the clone Second Chance. The first time they let Second Chance free, unbelievably he went and sat down under the original Chance’s favorite tree outside of Ralph’s kitchen window. This wasn’t the only strange thing. Second Chance also had the same eating pattern as the original Chance. He’d pull his head out of the food bucket to chew in between bites. Ralph had worked with animals his whole life but had never seen any animal do this except for Chance and Second Chance. Second Chance also seemed to recognize Ralph and always came to him. The doctors reminded Ralph that Second Chance was just a clone. He had the same DNA, but he wasn’t the same animal. Ralph and Sandy couldn’t help but feel that the original Chance had returned to them. As Second Chance grew, he began to look more and more like the original Chance. On his fourth birthday, Ralph invited friends and family to have a birthday party. Everyone took pictures with Second Chance, blew out candles and ate cake. At the end of the day, Ralph led Second Chance back to his stall. Until that day, Second Chance had seemed identical to Chance, but that night he did something very different. He attacked Ralph, goring him with his horns from behind. He slammed Ralph to the ground and stepped on him. Second Chance was over 2,000 pounds and badly injured Ralph. As he was being attacked, he couldn’t believe that Second Chance would do this to him. Ralph was in bad shape, but it wasn’t just his body that was damaged. He loved Second Chance like a family member and his feelings were also deeply hurt. Ralph couldn’t understand why Second Chance attacked him, but he forgave him. A year and a half later the same thing happened. Second Chance attacked Ralph again. This time he threw Ralph into the air and repeatedly rammed him. Again Ralph went to the hospital and needed stitches, and again Ralph forgave Second Chance. At the age of 8, Second Chance had problems with his stomach and died. Clones are known to have health problems, but the doctors couldn’t say if this is why he died. Ralph and his family were devastated again. His wife sent an email to friends about second Chance. It said, “We have given God the glory for giving Chance back all these 8 plus years, but it never occurred to us that by having a clone that we would lose him twice.”",
      "Running a marathon has always been a test of human strength and will power. To run a 42 km race is impressive for people in their 20s and 30s, but almost unheard of for the elderly. Amazingly, Fauja Singh was 89 years old when he ran his first marathon. Fauja was born in a small village in northwestern India in 1911. He was a weak child and crawled until the age of five. At the late age of 10, Fauja finally developed enough strength in his legs to properly walk. At that time, the only schools in the area were for rich people, so Fauja worked as a farmer. He married and had children, 3 boys and 3 girls. In 1992, his wife died and most of his children had already moved to England and Canada. Only his son Kuldip, stayed with him. Kuldip and Fauja were very close, working the farm and living in the same house. Then one day a tragedy hit. There was a violent storm with heavy winds. A piece of roofing flew off a restaurant and cut Kuldip’s head off. Fauja was devastated and fell into a deep depression. His other children were worried about him and brought him to England. It was in England when his depression lifted in an unusual way. He started to run with a group of Indian expats. As a child he was weak, but after a lifetime working on a farm he was in good shape. He began to challenge other elderly runners to races and he often won. As he ran, each step became a rhythmic meditation. He only heard his feet hitting the ground. His mind was clear and he felt at peace. When he was running he was able to forget his sadness and anger over losing his son. Aside from running, Fauja had little to do. For once in his life, he didn’t have a farm to work on. His son took care of him, so he no longer needed to work. In India he never owned a TV, but living in England, he had lots of free time and watched TV often. One day he saw people running a marathon on TV and decided that he would do one too. With only 10 weeks before the London marathon, Fauja knew he needed to train, so he found a running coach. Fauja was a simple farmer in India, but he had developed a taste for expensive clothes in England. He showed up for his first training session wearing a stylish 3-piece suit. After arguing with his new coach, he finally went and bought some running clothes. Fauja trained with his new coach every day and slowly increased the distance he ran. After 10 weeks of training he was ready. At the age of 89, he ran his first marathon in 6 hours and 54 minutes. Many non-professional runners do one marathon and feel satisfied. Not Fauja. At the age of 90, he ran it again. This time he completed it almost one hour faster. He was the fastest marathon runner in the world over 90. Fauja began to receive requests for interviews and TV. Adidas put him in a magazine ad bragging about his marathon running times. It said, “6:54 at age 89. 5:40 at age 92. The Kenyans better watch out for him when he hits 100.” Fauja continued to run marathons and break records. In 2003, he went to New York to run a marathon. Fauja is a Sikh and like all male Sikhs, he wears a turban. This was not long after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. At this time, there was a lot of anti-Muslim anger and to some Americans, the turban was a symbol of Islam. Fauja knew that some people would think he was a Muslim, but he welcomed the chance to proudly represent his culture. Not everyone was against him. Some people cheered him, but others called him Osama and Saddam. This was Fauja’s most difficult race. He developed bad blisters on his feet. The blisters broke and his feet soon were covered in blood. He couldn’t run anymore, but he wouldn’t stop walking. After 7 hours and 34 minutes, he crossed the finish line. He gave a quick interview with news reporters and then was taken to the hospital. Fauja only ran one more marathon at the age of 102. He has retired from races, but not from running. He said, “I’ll stop running when I die.”",
      "Mahatma Gandhi once said, “Each night, when I go to sleep, I die. And the next morning, when I wake up, I am reborn.” Gandhi isn’t the first one to compare sleep to death. Sleep provides such a precious break from our busy minds that it’s often compared to death and awakening in the morning to a rebirth. Of course, our mind isn’t always quiet during sleep. We are dreaming during 20% of the time we are sleeping. This dreaming stage is also called REM or Rapid Eye Movement. During REM our minds are very active, but our bodies are resting. At least, that’s true for most people. Mike Birbiglia has a sleep problem, called REM Behavior Disorder. For most people, the neurotransmitter dopamine is released during sleep. Neurotransmitters have many functions, but one thing dopamine does is paralyze the body during sleep. This keeps the sleeper from moving during their dreams. For people like Mike Birbiglia, things work a little differently. For 7 years, Mike had a recurring dream of a flying jackal monster. During one of these dreams, he jumped onto his bed in the middle of the night while he was still asleep. He was completely freaking out. He yelled to his girlfriend that there was a monster floating over their bed. He never studied karate, but for some weird reason he was in a karate stance ready to do battle. Abby told him there wasn’t any monster in the room. “Go back to sleep,” she said. Another night, Mike dreamed that he was in the Olympics. He had just won a vacuum cleaning contest. For some strange reason, vacuum cleaning was a sport, but the dream got even stranger. In his dream the ground began to shake, and he woke up to find himself on top of a bookshelf in his living room. He fell off the shelf and landed on some electronics, which broke into pieces. As he sat in the middle of his living room floor, surrounded by broken electronics, he wondered what happened. Abby woke him the next morning with the same question, “What happened?” Mike’s friends and family all told him to go to a doctor, but he told them he was too busy. Big mistake. A few years later, Mike was in Washington staying at a motel. He fell asleep watching the news. It was something about war, which seems to have infiltrated his dreams. He dreamed that he was in a room full of soldiers. There was a missile heading towards them. The soldiers told Mike that the missile was targeting him. Looking for a way to escape, he decided to jump out the window. This didn’t just happen in his dream. He actually decided to jump out of his actual motel room window. The scary thing was the window was closed and his room was on the second floor. He compares himself to the Incredible Hulk. If you don’t know the Incredible Hulk from movies, TV, and comic books, he’s a man that turns into a super strong monster when he becomes angry. Like the Incredible Hulk, he threw himself through the glass window. The glass broke and he flew through the air landing on the street. Just like the Hulk, he felt no pain as he hit the ground, stood up, and began to run. As he began to wake from his dream, he was running down the street, bloody, in his underwear. Mike went to the hospital and received 30 stitches to his arms and legs. The doctors were amazed and told him he should be dead. After his Incredible Hulk adventure, Mike decided it was finally time to see a doctor. He now takes medicine and sleeps in a sleeping bag zipped up to his neck. He also wears mittens to stop him from opening the sleeping bag when he dreams.",
      "Falling through the air is one of the most common dreams that people have. This dream is thought to symbolize the lack of control we have over our lives. To some extent, we all have to deal with events that we can’t control, so maybe that’s why falling is such an apt symbol of our fears. Seventeen-year-old Juliane Koepcke experienced the terror of falling one stormy Christmas Eve in 1971. Juliane was sitting in the window seat on a passenger plane out of Lima, Peru. She was on route to the city of Pucallpa in the Amazon forest with her mother, who was sitting between her and another passenger. Turbulence from the storm was causing the plane to lurch up and down. Then, in a single horrific moment, a bolt of lightning hit one of the plane’s fuel tanks and tore the right wing off. Lansa Flight 508 went into a nosedive, breaking apart in the process. As the filmmaker Werner Herzog, who made a documentary about Juliane’s experience, described it “She did not leave the airplane, the airplane left her.” The next thing Juliane knew, she was in free fall, still strapped to her seat. She remembers falling head first with her seatbelt digging into her waist. The dark green jungle canopy spun rapidly below her. It was at that point that Juliane lost consciousness. When she awoke the next morning, she found herself on the floor of the jungle, still strapped to her seat. The two seats next to her from her row on the plane were still there, but nobody was in them. Her mother and the other passenger had vanished. How could she have survived an incredible 3,000-meter fall through the air? Perhaps the absence of the other two passengers in the 3-bank seat caused a helicopter effect, similar to the seeds of maple trees that spin to the ground in the late summer. That, combined with an updraft of wind from the storm and the jungle canopy breaking her fall, helped her survive the fall from the sky. With a broken collarbone, a large gash in her right arm, and her right eye swollen shut, she made her way through the dense rainforest in search of help. A handful of sweets was her only source of food. Eventually, she found a small creek. At that moment, she remembered what her father - a biologist - had told her years before. “If you follow a stream, it will turn into a bigger stream, and then a bigger one, and eventually a river. Follow the river and you will ultimately reach a human settlement.” Down the stream and to a river she stumbled for days, braving poisonous snakes, insects, piranhas, and crocodiles. Maggots infested her arm and began eating her flesh. Hunger and thirst overwhelmed her, causing her to drink from the stream, while the harsh sun gave her 2nd-degree burns on her skin. By the 10th day, she could barely stand. Finally, she came across some loggers, who at first thought she was a mythical water goddess. They quickly tended to her wounds and helped her back to the safety of the city. Julianne was the sole survivor of the crash. While free fall was forced upon Juliane, there is one man who seeks it out for a living. Meet Jeb Corliss, otherwise known as the God of BASE Jumping. For as long as he can remember, Jeb always dreamed of flying. One of his earliest memories was when he was 6-years-old. He was sitting in the back seat of his of his aunt’s car watching birds jump from telephone poles, opening their wings and soaring through the air. He told his aunt that he wanted to do that, too. His aunt explained that when he got older, he would learn that humans can’t fly. “Maybe you can’t,” he replied, “but I’m going to.” And fly he has. Jeb has dedicated his life to realizing the dream of human flight. When he turned 18, he began skydiving, and that eventually led to the extreme sport of BASE jumping. BASE jumping is when you jump from a fixed structure, like a tower or cliff, achieve free fall, and then pull your parachute at the last second before making impact with the ground below. Through BASE jumping, Jeb discovered joy, purpose, and accomplishment. But he didn’t stop there. He quickly realized that if he wore a wingsuit, similar to the anatomic structure of a flying squirrel, he wouldn’t just fall straight down. He could also move horizontally. This was the closest thing to flying that man has ever known. Jeb lives on the edge of life and death through his flights. And he doesn’t simply jump and pull his parachute. Instead, Jeb pushes the envelope by attempting the seemingly impossible. He flies through valleys and canyons, tracing the contours of cliffs, ridges, and mountainsides at death defying speeds. In one of his most recent incredible feats, he jumped out of a helicopter and swooped through Heaven’s Gate, a natural arch in China’s famous Tianmen Mountain, at over 300 km per hour, in front of thousands of people. The margin of error was so small that even the slightest miscalculation in the angle of approach or gust of wind would have meant certain death for Jeb. The fear is powerful before and during the jumps, so much so that Jeb sometimes trembles and cries. But once he steps off that cliff or leaps off that helicopter, things get very simple: success is the only choice. As Jeb says, “It’s like a hurricane inside your head, every nerve ending is saying don’t do this. Once you take that step, there is no coming back. It will change you as a human being.” As Jeb sees it, success is inevitable. He explains, “I don’t believe you can fail. You only fail if you give up. The second you decide ‘Oh, I’ll just give up.’ That’s you! You’re the one making that choice. You’re the one choosing to fail. You have to make the decision to fail. Whereas if you don’t ever make that decision; you say, ‘No, I’m going to keep going until it fricking happens, well then you don’t fail. You’re just in the process of making it happen.” And there’s no doubt Jeb lives by these words. In early 2012, while flying off Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa, Jeb’s lower body struck a rock ledge in mid-flight. He broke both ankles, a leg, and three toes while sustaining a major bloody gash in his skin that required skin grafts to close. It is amazing that he was even able to pull his chute. While some would have taken that incident as a warning sign to give up, Jeb saw it as simply another a stepping stone in the path to making his dreams come true. A year-and-a-half later, he was back in the air, making it happen again. His ultimate dream is to jump out of a helicopter and land without a parachute, realizing one of the last great challenges remaining on earth: human flight. Some people call Jeb Corliss crazy. He responds by saying, “You want to know what I think is crazy? I think waking up at 6 AM, eating breakfast, then getting in a car and sitting in traffic for an hour-and-a-half on your way to a job, where you then sit in a box for eight hours, get a 30-minute break to eat some lunch, get back in that car to sit in traffic for another hour-and-a-half on your way home where you eat dinner, watch some TV, and go to sleep. Repeat that until you’re about 60, you retire and then you die. I think that is absolutely insane.” For Julianne, falling was terrifying, and for good reason. She was out of control, and her life was on the line. For Jeb, falling is a conscious choice, and he does have some degree of control. Of course, it is still terrifying, and he could die at any moment, but isn’t this true for all of us? One thing that none of us has control over is death. And since death is inevitable, we are all in a symbolic type of free fall. The end is the bottom of our fall, and we all reach it; no exceptions. But as Jeb explains after surviving another close encounter with instant death: “I’m just so happy. I’m just so happy to still be here. You know, my time in this world is limited. But the things that I can do with that time are not. We are all going to die. The question is are you going to live while you’re here.”",
      "Harry Houdini was a world famous escape artist. He once escaped from a steel and glass coffin hung upside down and filled with water. Yet when his mother died in 1920, the great Houdini couldn’t find a way to escape his own heartbreak and loss. In desperation, the legendary showman turned to spiritualism, a system of belief based on communicating with the dead. Houdini was a hard man to convince there was such a thing as life after death. Before he made his name as an escape artist, Houdini and his wife Bess often gave fake public séances to put bread on the table. He knew all about the trickery used by mediums. However, Houdini was a desperate man and longed to communicate with his mother beyond the grave. His search for hard and fast proof was all in vain. He said that all the mediums he met were “human leeches.” Houdini was good friends with Sherlock Holmes author Arthur Conan Doyle. However, their friendship ended after Conan Doyle’s wife Jean claimed to have made contact with Houdini’s dead mother through a technique called automatic writing. Jean swore the 15 pages of grammatically correct English was a real message from the afterlife. Houdini dismissed it publicly. He said that while his mother had mastered five languages, English was not one of them. Houdini soon began to expose fraudulent mediums. He declared war on those who exploited people’s grief to turn a buck. He hounded the scam artists at every chance. His experiences didn’t completely close Houdini’s mind to the possibility of an afterlife, though. Before he died in 1926, he made a pact with his wife Bess that, if possible, he would make contact with her from the other side. He created a secret code only she would know. After Houdini died, Bess offered $ 10,000 to anyone who could help contact her husband. In 1928, a man named Arthur Ford claimed he had received a message from Houdini. Bess announced the message used the secret code and was genuine. Bess held the last official ‘Houdini séance’ on Halloween in 1936. It was broadcast via radio across the world. Houdini was a no-show and Bess agreed it was time to pull the plug on the séances. As the last séance reached its conclusion a terrible storm raged. Thunder and lightning filled the skies. Many thought it was Houdini’s last act from beyond the grave. Others thought it was mere coincidence. Attempts to make contact with the dead have existed throughout history in most cultures. But it isn’t just about talking to the dead. We want to know that we will live on after death or at least be remembered. One way to be remembered is to donate your organs after death to someone in need. In addition to giving a sick person a new lease on life, some people think an organ transplant can also transform the recipient’s personality. Take the case of 24-year-old Australian David Walters. He awoke from a heart transplant to find he had suddenly developed an insatiable craving for a certain flavor of chip. When he tracked down the family of his heart donor, he learned that the 18-year-old donor had enjoyed eating that flavor daily. In 2014, British man Kevin Mashford underwent a lifesaving heart transplant. After the operation, he asked hospital staff for a stationary exercise bike and started to cycle every day. A couple of months after leaving the hospital Kevin purchased a road bike for the first time in his life. Before his transplant, Kevin hadn’t spent hardly any time on two wheels, but now he was hooked on his new hobby. Kevin received his heart from a man called John, a keen cyclist who was killed in a collision. Kevin says he took up cycling to honor John’s memory. He doesn’t believe he inherited a part of John’s personality, but some people do say it’s possible. There have been over 70 cases of transplant patients supposedly inheriting personality traits of their donors. Sonny Graham’s experience was not as positive as Kevin’s or as harmless as David’s. The American man was on death’s door when a donor’s heart saved his life. The heart had belonged to a man called Terry Cottle. Terry was 33 years old when he died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head. After the operation, Sonny reached out to Terry’s widow Cheryl to thank her. Something strange happened when they met. He said, “I felt like I had known her for years. I couldn’t keep my eyes off her.” The two fell in love and got married. Twelve years after the operation Sonny’s life ended in similar circumstances to that of his donor. He shot himself with a shotgun. His suicide was unexpected. Friends and family could not explain it. Most people would say it was simply a terrible coincidence, but others believe the heart beating in Sonny’s chest influenced his actions. Transplant operations are commonplace, but there have been few studies on what, if anything, is transmitted alongside human cells. Oxford University’s Head of Transplantation Professor Peter Friend says, “My personal gut feeling is we have no scientific rationale to support this. But we should also be open-minded about things we can’t explain.” Humans have always tried to transcend death or at least be remembered. But who will remember us when there is no one left to remember? Between our propensity for war and environmental destruction, some say that humanity’s days are numbered. And even if we do evolve to a more peace-loving species, our earth has an expiration date. Somewhere between 1.75 billion and 3.25 billion years from now, the Earth will be so close to the Sun that all the water will evaporate. And no water means no life. Perhaps by that time, humanity will have left our earthly home, but probably we will be just a cosmic memory. The only proof that humans ever existed will be two golden records created in 1977. These two records are messages sent deep into space in hopes of one day reaching alien life. They are flying aboard the Voyager I and Voyager II NASA spacecraft that left Earth in the summer of 1977. The Voyager spacecraft’s mission was to record and send back data and images of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They have now long passed these planets. The spacecraft and its golden records are traveling at over 60,000 kilometers an hour. To be more precise, that is 17 kilometers a second. The Voyager I is now 20 billion kilometers away from Earth and has left our solar system. Amazingly, the onboard 1970s built computers are still in touch with Earth. The plutonium batteries aboard the Voyager I and II will only last another ten years or so. But even without power, they will continue their speedy journey across the universe. The contents of the golden records contain spoken greetings in 55 languages. In Arabic, it says, “Greetings to our friends in the stars. May time bring us together.” In English, it says, “Hello from the children of planet Earth.” And in Amoy it says, “Friends of space, how are you all? Have you eaten yet? Come visit us if you have time.” The records also contain 90 minutes of music. Space was limited on the record, so the producers of the record couldn’t do justice to the depth of human musical expression. They did do their best to choose a selection of different styles including indigenous music, to classical music to rock and roll. The Beatles agreed to have the song “Here Comes the Sun” on the record, but it didn’t make the cut. Apparently, their stingy record company was worried that aliens would get to listen for free so they refused. The record also includes sounds of earth from wind to waves to heartbeats, to whale songs, and even the sound of a kiss. It also has brainwave recordings of a woman contemplating the history of humanity and falling in love. And finally, there are images expressing our knowledge of the stars, chemistry, and biology, as well as photos of nature and humans. Engraved on the record cover are image-based instructions on how to play the record and a map showing our position in the universe. Not everyone was on board with the map though. Some feared that giving away our location to a possibly hostile alien race might not be the smartest thing to do. US President Jimmy Carter had a more hopeful view of future aliens receiving our message. He included the following message on the Voyager spacecraft: “This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts, and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome universe.”",
      "Monday dawned warm and rainless. Aurelio Escovar, a dentist without a degree, and a very early riser, opened his office at six. He took some false teeth, still mounted in their plaster mold, out of the glass case and put on the table a fistful of instruments which he arranged in size order, as if they were on display.  He wore a collarless striped shirt, closed at the neck with a golden stud, and pants held up by suspenders. He was erect and skinny, with a look that rarely corresponded to the situation, the way deaf people have of looking.When he had things arranged on the table, he pulled the drill toward the dental chair and sat down to polish the false teeth. He seemed not to be thinking about what he was doing, but worked steadily, pumping the drill with his feet, even when he didn’t need it.After eight he stopped for a while to look at the sky through the window, and he saw two pensive buzzards who were drying themselves in the sun on the ridgepole of the house next door. He went on working with the idea that before lunch it would rain again.The shrill voice of his eleven-year-old son interrupted his concentration. “Papa.” “What?” “The Mayor wants to know if you’ll pull his tooth.” “Tell him I’m not here.”He was polishing a gold tooth. He held it at arm’s length, and examined it with his eyes half closed. His son shouted again from the little waiting room. “He says you are, too, because he can hear you.”The dentist kept examining the tooth. Only when he had put it on the table with the finished work did he say: “So much the better.” He operated the drill again. He took several pieces of a bridge out of a cardboard box where he kept the things he still had to do and began to polish the gold.“Papa.” “What?” He still hadn’t changed his expression. “He says if you don’t take out his tooth, he’ll shoot you.” Without hurrying, with an extremely tranquil movement, he stopped pedaling the drill, pushed it away from the chair, and pulled the lower drawer of the table all the way out. There was a revolver. “O.K.,” he said. “Tell him to come and shoot me.”He rolled the chair over opposite the door, his hand resting on the edge of the drawer. The Mayor appeared at the door. He had shaved the left side of his face, but the other side, swollen and in pain, had a five-day-old beard.The dentist saw many nights of desperation in his dull eyes. He closed the drawer with his fingertips and said softly: “Sit down.” “Good morning,” said the Mayor. “Morning,” said the dentist.While the instruments were boiling, the Mayor leaned his skull on the headrest of the chair and felt better. His breath was icy. It was a poor office: an old wooden chair, the pedal drill, a glass case with ceramic bottles. Opposite the chair was a window with a shoulder-high cloth curtain. When he felt the dentist approach, the Mayor braced his heels and opened his mouth.Aurelio Escovar turned his head toward the light. After inspecting the infected tooth, he closed the Mayor’s jaw with a cautious pressure of his fingers. “It has to be without anesthesia,” he said. “Why?” “Because you have an abscess.” The Mayor looked him in the eye. “All right,” he said, and tried to smile.The dentist did not return the smile. He brought the basin of sterilized instruments to the worktable and took them out of the water with a pair of cold tweezers, still without hurrying. Then he pushed the spittoon with the tip of his shoe, and went to wash his hands in the washbasin. He did all this without looking at the Mayor. But the Mayor didn’t take his eyes off him.It was a lower wisdom tooth. The dentist spread his feet and grasped the tooth with the hot forceps. The Mayor seized the arms of the chair, braced his feet with all his strength, and felt an icy void in his kidneys, but didn’t make a sound. The dentist moved only his wrist. Without rancor, rather with a bitter tenderness, he said: “Now you’ll pay for our twenty dead men.”The Mayor felt the crunch of bones in his jaw, and his eyes filled with tears. But he didn’t breathe until he felt the tooth come out. Then he saw it through his tears. It seemed so foreign to his pain that he failed to understand his torture of the five previous nights.Bent over the spittoon, sweating, panting, he unbuttoned his tunic and reached for the handkerchief in his pants pocket. The dentist gave him a clean cloth. “Dry your tears,” he said. The Mayor did. He was trembling. While the dentist washed his hands, he saw the crumbling ceiling and a dusty spider web with spider’s eggs and dead insects.The dentist returned, drying his hands. “Go to bed,” he said, “and gargle with salt water.” The Mayor stood up, said goodbye with a casual military salute, and walked toward the door, stretching his legs, without buttoning up his tunic.“Send the bill,” he said. “To you or the town?” The Mayor didn’t look at him. He closed the door and said through the screen: “It’s the same damn thing.”"
